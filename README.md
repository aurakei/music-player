## Introduction

This project is a basic music player app created with React. It features a title bar with a search bar, a left component for the library or recent played songs, a central component for the now playing song and search results, and a right component for displaying song lyrics.

## Features

- Add songs to the playlist.
- Play, pause, skip, and control playback of songs.
- View song details such as title, artist, and release date.
- Search for artists, bands, tracks, and podcasts.
- Customize the app with a dark mode option.

## Future Development:
In future updates, we plan to enhance the app with the following features:

* Lyrics Integration: Users will be able to add their own lyrics for the songs in their playlist.
* Beat Requests: Users can request beats from the app based on the genre of the song they're listening to. This feature will provide a curated selection of beats to complement the user's music preferences.

Stay tuned for exciting updates as we continue to improve the app and add new functionalities!
